            <h4>
                Cats Going on a Picnic
            </h4>
            <p> 
                I came across this photo the other day and I really liked it. It symbolises me, if I were a cat and I went on a picnic with someone I liked. 
                I think I would be the ginger cat, because it's a little bit cuter than the white cat.
                The ginger cat is also fluffier and I like the way it's holding onto its feet. 
                This picture is so cute because the cats aren't really anywhere special, you can see in the background that they're just in a field or something.
                It doesn't matter where the cats are, they are just enjoying each other's company. 
                I find that really cute. I also like that they are sharing a whole entire cake between them. 
                It's way too much food for two little cats in the middle of the day.

                A Cat Asking to be Picked Up
            </h4>
            <p> 
                My second cat entry - how exciting! So, a little bit about this photo ... <br>
                This cat is simply asking to be picked up and held. This is so cute, but also rare, because cats aren't really that affectionate.

            <h4>Two Cats with Sunnies on</h4>
            <p>
                First of all ... how did the person taking this picture manage to put sunnies on not one, but TWO cats! And then take a picture at the right time? <br>
                Almost impossible to me. I love this photo because I think it's so cute when cats wear clothes or accessories. I identify with the white cat, mostly because, again, it's the cuter cat. <br>
                I'm not a narcissist, but if the opporunity arises, I will choose to "be" the cuter cat. <br>

            <h4>Oh no! This Cat is Crying ... </h4>
            <p>
                OK, not to ruin the mood or anything with this crying cat, but I really think I look like this sometimes. You know when you're just doing your make-up and it doesn't
                look that nice and you have somewhere to go and you don't want to go have a shower to wash it off because you JUST did your hair ... so you're looking at yourself in the 
                mirror and just wondering "What if I cancel? I look horrible anyway!!!" - that's what this cat is conveying to me. But its OK. We all have our moments. I still love this cat
                picture no matter how she is feeling.

            <p>
                This is a suggested cat from one of my fans! This cat is celebrating with a big thumbs up on a job well done. I am learning so much about building websites
                and coding, even though it doesn't really look like it ... I hope you are all enjoying this website and looking forward to the updates. You can send me fanmail.
                Cash is also preferred and welcome.

            <h4>YAY! Cat</h4>
            <p>So sweet. This is called the YAY! cat. It's a little happy dance that cute cats do when they're happy. When are they happy? When they eat tuna, I suppose.
                I used to really be against tuna and then I had it in sushi and it was fine. For some reason, I decided to hate tuna. Probably because it is smelly.
                Cats like tuna, even though it smells bad. So cute. They don't care. They're happy anyway!

            <h3 class="fruitsheader">Fruits and Foods That I Like</h3>
            <p class="secondp">Welcome to the second part of my blog. Here, I will be talking a little bit about fruits and foods. I know fruit is a food, and it's a bit redundant to say
            fruits AND foods, so I'd thought I might specify. A lot of my diet is fruit. I actually kept a food diary for my dietitian in the earlier parts of February and most
            of my diet was nectarines. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. I might actually go cut one up and eat one now. <br>
            I just went and got a nectarine from my fridge and cut it up. It's a little bit sour. I don't hate it, but I'm not really tempted to go cut up another one either. <br>
            Below will be a small gallery of some food I've eaten recently. I don't have photos of the fruits I've eaten, because, well ... I don't really take pictures of fruit.
            It's simply not that exciting. Also, there is a pic of dog treats in here. I didn't eat the dog treats. I just added photos from my iPhone under search bar "food"
            and it came up, so I added it for range.

        <h3 class="holidayheader"> Chapter Two: Story Blogs...</h3>
        <h4 class="holiday-subheader">I went on a HOLIDAY and here's what I did </h4>

        <div class="third-grid-container">
            <div class="holiday-text-container">
                <p class="holiday-text holiday-p">
                Is it classified as a holiday if I just went home? What does Google say ... OK, Google says "an extended period of leisure and recreation, 
                especially one spent away from home or in travelling." This is vague. I mean, I went back HOME on a holiday, well in the near vicinity of my home. 
                I went to Taronga Zoo and saw some animals. I feel bad a little. I paid for the animals to be caged and I looked at them while they were trapped.
                The zoo-keepers spoke a lot about conservation and all that stuff, but ... they're still trapped. I actually don't know much about this topic at all, so I'm
                not judging or anything, I'm just saying I felt a little bit bad. I wonder if they rotate the giraffes. Like, it would be so boring to be a giraffe
                in the zoo that did the same thing all the time. Wake up, get fed, get looked at and then sleep. <br>
                The giraffes I saw were so cute. I brought my camera to the zoo
                and took photos of some of the animals. The most remarkable animal was the giraffe! Their necks were so freaky long and their enclosure was right above
                the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. It's a little but funny, considering how tall they are and they were given the best view. I feel like a smaller-necked animal
                would be better suited for that place. You could place the giraffes anywhere and they could still see the view. ARE YOU PICKING UP WHAT I'M PUTTING DOWN?! <br>
                So, other than the giraffes, what else did I see or do? I also saw a lovely pygmy hippo. <br>
                It would be so refreshing to be a pygmy hippo ... because first of all, you're always swim swim swimming around and second of all, you actually are like super
                hairless, so you would glide in the water so easily. The worst thing about washing your hair is that you have damp hair. I actually have damp hair right now. 
                I'm sitting here, with my wet hair propped up on my head in a bun, held up by a shitty Cotton-On hair clip that is kinda broken. The clip's teeth is like wonky
                because I put it in my gym bag and I think I kicked my gym bag or something and the teeth went wonky. It still works, but I probably wouldn't ever sell it on Depop.
                Back to the animals. I also saw a tiger. I read a thing - actually, I watched a TikTok, but this sounds better - and it was talking about how tigers camoflauge. 
                The tiger is orange, but its environment is not orange. So, how does it blend in? Well, turns out our human eyes perceive colours differently than other animals!
                This is actually so obvious, but we totally forget things like this. It's like when Americans forget that there are non-Americans in the world and their whole
                life view shatters. I took a photo of the tiger when it was sleeping on the car. I'll put all my Taronga Zoo pics in the bottom right corner grid. <br>
                Which is actually the whole point of this drivel. I just wanted to type enough text to fill up space, so the grid would be nice! and! pretty! <br>                OK, that actually took ages to figure out ... 
                Also, this webpage is just going to be a very long webpage because its free. I'm a little bit hungry at the moment. But it's like 8pm so I don't really feel
                like cooking anything. I was supposed to put some butter chicken in the airfryer. I should do that now. Oh! Even worse. My laptop clock is off by a few minutes.
                That's really annoying. <br>
                I'm going to do another grid thing soon. I feel like having two days on the weekend is a bit stingy. I need more days to study. I'm a slow person. 
                Should I just make an acai? I might just do that. Oh, wait! I have weet-bix! NO WAIT I HAVE YOGHURT! I bought some today from Aldi. I'm going to go and 
                get it from my fridge. It's a lot cheaper than the YoPro ones, but they're kinda watered down. ALDI don't come for me for slander, please! This is my just
                my experience. I think I might just get the YoPro ones next time. I just had two of them, and it was just like having one YoPro. <br>
                Umm ... <br>
                This has nothing to do with my holiday anymore ... <br>
                Right then ...
