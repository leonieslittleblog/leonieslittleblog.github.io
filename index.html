                Cats Going on a Picnic
            </h3>
            <p> 
                I came across this photo the other day and I really liked it. It symbolises me, if I were a cat and I went on a picnic with someone I liked. 
                I think I would be the ginger cat, because it's a little bit cuter than the white cat.
                The ginger cat is also fluffier and I like the way it's holding onto its feet. 
                This picture is so cute because the cats aren't really anywhere special, you can see in the background that they're just in a field or something.
                It doesn't matter where the cats are, they are just enjoying each other's company. 
                I find that really cute. I also like that they are sharing a whole entire cake between them. 
                It's way too much food for two little cats in the middle of the day.

                A Cat Asking to be Picked Up
            </h3>
            <p> 
                My second cat entry - how exciting! So, a little bit about this photo ... <br>
                This cat is simply asking to be picked up and held. This is so cute, but also rare, because cats aren't really that affectionate.

            <h3>Two Cats with Sunnies on</h3>
            <p>
                First of all ... how did the person taking this picture manage to put sunnies on not one, but TWO cats! And then take a picture at the right time? <br>
                Almost impossible to me. I love this photo because I think it's so cute when cats wear clothes or accessories. I identify with the white cat, mostly because, again, it's the cuter cat. <br>
                I'm not a narcissist, but if the opporunity arises, I will choose to "be" the cuter cat. <br>

            <h3>Oh no! This Cat is Crying ... </h3>
            <p>
                OK, not to ruin the mood or anything with this crying cat, but I really think I look like this sometimes. You know when you're just doing your make-up and it doesn't
                look that nice and you have somewhere to go and you don't want to go have a shower to wash it off because you JUST did your hair ... so you're looking at yourself in the 
                mirror and just wondering "What if I cancel? I look horrible anyway!!!" - that's what this cat is conveying to me. But its OK. We all have our moments. I still love this cat
                picture no matter how she is feeling.

            <p>
                This is a suggested cat from one of my fans! This cat is celebrating with a big thumbs up on a job well done. I am learning so much about building websites
                and coding, even though it doesn't really look like it ... I hope you are all enjoying this website and looking forward to the updates. You can send me fanmail.
